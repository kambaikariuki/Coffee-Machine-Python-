# Coffee-Machine-Python
A HyperSkill project - A simple coffee machine made with Python that can take coffee orders on request.
It already has resources in place such as coffee beans, cups, milk and water.
You may need to refill these resources as you continue to take orders, to allow you to make more coffee.
The machine displays its current resources including money available which you can also withdraw.
You can make changes to the existing resources and prices by editing them in the modules file.
